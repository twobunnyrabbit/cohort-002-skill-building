We're going to add a new tool to our agent system - one that asks clarifying questions when a user's request is missing critical information.

This is inspired by [Claude's approach](/PLACEHOLDER/claude-clarifying-questions) to handling ambiguous user requests. Instead of guessing what the user wants, the agent will intelligently recognize when it needs more details and ask for them using a structured UI.

The challenge here is significant: we have many tools competing for the [LLM's](/PLACEHOLDER/llm) attention. You'll need to use careful [tool descriptions](/PLACEHOLDER/tool-descriptions) and system prompts to make sure the agent recognizes when clarification is truly needed.

## Steps To Complete

### Set Up Your Evaluation

- [ ] Review the test cases in `ask-for-clarification.eval.ts`

The eval file contains several scenarios where users make incomplete requests:

```ts
data: [
  // Flight booking with missing critical details
  {
    input: createUIMessageFixture('Book a flight to Paris'),
  },
  // Email with missing recipient details
  {
    input: createUIMessageFixture('Send John an email'),
  },
  // Invoice creation with no details
  {
    input: createUIMessageFixture(
      'Create an invoice for the client',
    ),
  },
  // TODO: add more test cases here
],
```

- [ ] Add 7-10 more test cases with incomplete requests

These should represent scenarios missing critical information. Consider:

- Translation requests without target language or text
- Weather checks without a location
- Social media posts without content or scheduling time
- Task creation with no details
- Calendar searches without specifics
- File compression without source/destination paths

### Implement the Scorer

- [ ] Implement the `Called askForClarification` scorer

This scorer checks whether the agent called the `askForClarification` tool:

```ts
scorers: [
  {
    name: 'Called askForClarification',
    description:
      'The agent called the askForClarification tool',
    scorer: ({ output }) => {
      // TODO: Implement the scorer
      // Return 1 if askForClarification was called, 0 otherwise
      // Hint: Check if any tool in output.toolCalls has toolName === 'askForClarification'
      return 0;
    },
  },
],
```

The scorer should return `1` if any [tool call](/PLACEHOLDER/tool-calling) has `toolName === 'askForClarification'`, and `0` otherwise.

### Build the askForClarification Tool

- [ ] Define the schema for the `askForClarification` tool in `agent.ts`

The tool needs a `questions` array. Each question object should have:

- `question`: The question text
- `field`: The field name this question relates to
- `options`: An array of pre-filled answer choices

Here's the structure to start with:

```ts
askForClarification: tool({
  // TODO: Write a description for the tool
  description: '',
  inputSchema: z.object({
    // TODO: Add the schema here
  }),
  execute: async () => {
    return 'askForClarification tool called';
  },
}),
```

- [ ] Write a clear description for the tool

The description should explain when this tool should be used - specifically when a request is missing critical information needed to complete the task.

Use the [describe()](/PLACEHOLDER/zod-describe) method on your [Zod schema](/PLACEHOLDER/zod-schema) to provide detailed field descriptions. This helps guide the [LLM](/PLACEHOLDER/llm) toward choosing the right tool.

### Configure the System Prompt

- [ ] Update the system prompt in `runAgent()` to instruct the agent when to use this tool

```ts
system: `Today's date is ${new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]}.

// TODO: Update the system prompt to instruct the agent to use the
// askForClarification tool when the user's request is missing
// critical information needed to complete the task
`,
```

Your system prompt should:

- Explain when to use the `askForClarification` tool
- Provide concrete examples showing how the tool should be called
- Include example questions, fields, and pre-filled options for scenarios like flight bookings, emails, and invoices
- Clarify that the tool should ONLY be used when information is truly missing
- Emphasize that other tools should NOT be called if clarification is needed first

Look at the solution file for inspiration on the structure and detail level needed in these examples.

### Test Your Implementation

- [ ] Run the evaluation with `pnpm run dev`

You should see your eval running and showing results for each test case.

- [ ] Check that the `Called askForClarification` scorer is working

The scorer should show `1` for each test case where the agent correctly called the tool, and `0` for cases where it didn't.

- [ ] Iterate on your tool description and system prompt until you reach 100%

This will likely require several iterations. Pay close attention to:

- The clarity of your [tool description](/PLACEHOLDER/tool-descriptions)
- The quality of your system prompt examples
- Whether you need to adjust the [Zod schema](/PLACEHOLDER/zod-schema) fields to guide the agent better

Each iteration should bring you closer to perfect recognition of ambiguous requests.

- [ ] (Optional) Test with multiple models using [evalite.each()](/PLACEHOLDER/evalite-each)

Try testing with both [Gemini 2.0 Flash](/PLACEHOLDER/gemini-2-0-flash) and [GPT-4 Mini](/PLACEHOLDER/gpt-4-mini) to see if different models have different success rates at recognizing when clarification is needed.
