# Building a Memory System for Personal Assistants

Personal assistants need to truly understand who you are. They need to know your preferences, habits, and important details about your life.

An [LLM system](/PLACEHOLDER/llm-systems) that learns and retains this information is a long-term goal for many AI applications. It's an area of extremely active research.

The [AI SDK](/PLACEHOLDER/ai-sdk) provides all the primitives you need to build a memory system. However, the real challenge is in the implementation details.

In this exercise, you'll build the foundational pieces: loading memories from a database, displaying them to the model, and extracting new permanent memories from each conversation.

## Steps To Complete

### Understanding Memory Systems

- [ ] Understand why personal assistants need memory systems

Memory systems allow [LLMs](/PLACEHOLDER/large-language-models) to retain information about users across conversations. This enables:

- Learning user preferences and habits over time
- Providing personalized assistance
- Building trust through demonstrated understanding

### Loading Memories From The Database

- [ ] Review the code structure in `api/chat.ts`

Look at the POST route handler where incoming chat messages are processed. The system prompt currently has a placeholder for memories in XML tags.

- [ ] Locate the imported memory functions

The [`loadMemories`](/PLACEHOLDER/load-memories) and [`saveMemories`](/PLACEHOLDER/save-memories) functions are already imported:

```ts
import {
  loadMemories,
  saveMemories,
  type DB,
} from './memory-persistence.ts';
```

- [ ] Load memories from the database in the POST route

Use the [`loadMemories()`](/PLACEHOLDER/load-memories) function to fetch memories from the database and store the result in a variable:

```ts
// TODO: Use the loadMemories function to load the memories from the database
const memories = await loadMemories();
```

### Formatting Memories For The System Prompt

- [ ] Review the `formatMemory()` function

This function takes a single memory item and formats it nicely for display:

```ts
const formatMemory = (memory: DB.MemoryItem) => {
  return [
    `Memory: ${memory.memory}`,
    `Created At: ${memory.createdAt}`,
  ].join('\n');
};
```

- [ ] Format the loaded memories for the system prompt

Use the `formatMemory()` function to format each memory item and join them together. Store the result in the `memoriesText` variable:

```ts
// TODO: Format the memories to display in the UI using the formatMemory function
const memoriesText = memories.map(formatMemory).join('\n\n');
```

### Extracting New Memories

- [ ] Understand the memory extraction process

The [`onFinish`](/PLACEHOLDER/on-finish) callback runs after the model responds. This is where new memories are extracted and saved.

- [ ] Generate new memories from the conversation

Use [`generateObject()`](/PLACEHOLDER/generate-object) to analyze the full conversation and extract memories. Pass it the entire [message history](/PLACEHOLDER/message-history) and existing memories:

```ts
onFinish: async (response) => {
  const allMessages = [...messages, ...response.messages];

  // TODO: Generate the memories using the generateObject function
  // Pass it the entire message history and the existing memories
  // Write a system prompt that tells the LLM to only focus on permanent memories
  // and not temporary or situational information
  const memoriesResult = TODO;

  const newMemories = memoriesResult.object.memories;

  // TODO: Save the new memories to the database using the saveMemories function
},
```

Write a system prompt that focuses on permanent memories about the user - their attributes, preferences, and long-term information. Avoid temporary or situational details.

- [ ] Extract the memories from the result object

After [`generateObject()`](/PLACEHOLDER/generate-object) completes, access the memories array stored in `memoriesResult.object.memories`:

```ts
const newMemories = memoriesResult.object.memories;
```

### Saving And Logging Memories

- [ ] Add a console log to track extracted memories

Log the `newMemories` array so you can see what's being saved:

```ts
console.log('newMemories', newMemories);
```

- [ ] Save the extracted memories to the database

Create memory objects with the required fields: `id`, `memory`, and `createdAt`. Use [`generateId()`](/PLACEHOLDER/generate-id) for each memory's ID and `new Date().toISOString()` for the timestamp:

```ts
const newMemories = memoriesResult.object.memories;

console.log('newMemories', newMemories);

saveMemories(
  // TODO: Map over the newMemories array and create memory objects with the required fields
  TODO,
);
```

### Testing The Memory System

- [ ] Run the application

Start the dev server with the command:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

- [ ] Open the chat interface

Navigate to `localhost:3000` in your browser. You should see the chat interface with the pre-filled message: "Interview me about my life and work. Ask one question at a time."

- [ ] Send the initial message

Send the pre-filled message and observe the conversation. The assistant will ask you questions about your life and work. Answer the questions to provide material for memory extraction.

- [ ] Check the server console for memory extraction logs

Look for output showing what memories were extracted:

```txt
newMemories [
  'User works as a software engineer',
  'User is learning TypeScript',
  'User prefers concise explanations'
]
```

- [ ] Inspect the generated memories file

Navigate to the `data` directory and open `memories.local.json`. After several exchanges, the file should contain extracted memories:

```json
{
  "memories": [
    {
      "id": "a1b2c3d4",
      "memory": "User works as a software engineer",
      "createdAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:45.123Z"
    },
    {
      "id": "e5f6g7h8",
      "memory": "User is learning TypeScript",
      "createdAt": "2024-01-15T10:31:22.456Z"
    },
    {
      "id": "i9j0k1l2",
      "memory": "User prefers concise explanations",
      "createdAt": "2024-01-15T10:32:01.789Z"
    },
    {
      "id": "m3n4o5p6",
      "memory": "User has a dog named Max",
      "createdAt": "2024-01-15T10:33:15.234Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

- [ ] Test memory persistence across conversations

Have several exchanges with the assistant. Check that:

- New memories are added to the database
- Memories persist across new conversations
- The assistant references stored memories in its [system prompt](/PLACEHOLDER/system-prompt)
