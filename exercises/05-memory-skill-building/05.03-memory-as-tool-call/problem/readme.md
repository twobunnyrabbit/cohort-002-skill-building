Our previous memory setup was a little wasteful. Every time the conversation finished streaming, we'd automatically extract memories by calling [`generateObject()`](/PLACEHOLDER/ai-sdk-generate-object). This meant the LLM couldn't decide when memories actually needed updating.

What if we let the LLM decide for itself? We can use a [tool calling](/PLACEHOLDER/ai-sdk-tool-calling) loop to give the model control over when to update memories. When users share personal information, contradict previous details, or ask to remember something, the model can call a `manageMemories` tool.

This is more efficient and gives the agent better judgment about what's actually worth remembering.

## Steps To Complete

### Setting Up The Memory Management Tool

- [ ] Open `api/chat.ts` and locate the `tools` object in the [`streamText`](/PLACEHOLDER/ai-sdk-stream-text) call

You'll see a TODO comment where the `manageMemories` tool should be defined. This tool needs to handle three operations: updates, deletions, and additions.

- [ ] Create the `manageMemories` tool using the [`tool()`](/PLACEHOLDER/ai-sdk-tool-function) function

When you use [`tool()`](/PLACEHOLDER/ai-sdk-tool-function), you'll define a schema with three parameters:

| Parameter   | Type             | Purpose                                                        |
| ----------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `updates`   | Array of objects | Update existing memories with `{ id: string, memory: string }` |
| `deletions` | Array of strings | Delete memories by ID                                          |
| `additions` | Array of strings | Add new memories to the system                                 |

```ts
tools: {
  manageMemories: tool({
    // TODO: Add description for the tool
    description: '',
    inputSchema: z.object({
      // TODO: Add updates, deletions, and additions to the schema
    }),
    execute: async ({ updates, deletions, additions }) => {
      // TODO: Perform the actual memory operations
      // Handle updates, deletions, and additions
      // Return a success message
      return TODO;
    },
  }),
},
```

- [ ] Implement the `execute` function for the tool

In your implementation:

1. Filter out deletions that are being updated (to avoid conflicts)
2. Call [`updateMemory()`](/PLACEHOLDER/update-memory) for each update
3. Call [`deleteMemory()`](/PLACEHOLDER/delete-memory) for each deletion
4. Call [`saveMemories()`](/PLACEHOLDER/save-memories) for each addition, creating memory objects with `id`, `memory`, and `createdAt` fields

```ts
execute: async ({ updates, deletions, additions }) => {
  // TODO: Perform the actual memory operations
  // Handle updates, deletions, and additions

  // TODO: Return a success message
  return TODO;
},
```

### Enabling Tool Calling With stopWhen

- [ ] Locate the TODO comment for [`stopWhen`](/PLACEHOLDER/ai-sdk-stop-when) in the [`streamText`](/PLACEHOLDER/ai-sdk-stream-text) call

This property controls when the model stops generating and how many [tool calls](/PLACEHOLDER/ai-sdk-tool-calling) it can make.

- [ ] Add a stop condition using `stepCountIs(5)`

This allows up to 5 generation steps, giving the model room to call tools multiple times if needed.

```ts
stopWhen: stepCountIs(5),
```

### Improving The System Prompt

- [ ] Review the system prompt in the [`streamText`](/PLACEHOLDER/ai-sdk-stream-text) call

Currently it loads memories but doesn't guide the model on when to use the tool. You need to enhance it with guidance for tool usage.

- [ ] Update the system prompt with clear instructions

Add guidance on:

- When to call `manageMemories` (user shares personal info, contradicts previous statements, asks to remember/forget)
- When to skip the tool (casual small talk, temporary questions)
- That batching multiple conversation turns is acceptable

```ts
system: `
${loadMemories()}

When users share new personal information, contradict previous information, or ask you to remember or forget things, use the manageMemories tool to update the memory system.

// TODO: Add guidelines for when to use the tool and when to skip it
`,
```

### Testing The Tool-Based Memory System

- [ ] Run the application with `pnpm run dev`

- [ ] Open `localhost:3000` in your browser

The chat interface will load with the pre-filled message.

- [ ] Start a conversation by sending "Interview me about my life and work. Ask one question at a time."

The model will begin asking questions about your life and work.

- [ ] Answer with personal information in your responses

Share details about your job, hobbies, preferences, or experiences. As you provide this information, watch what happens next.

- [ ] Check the server console for tool call logs

Look for output showing when `manageMemories` is being called. You should see which memories are being added, updated, or deleted.

```txt
Memory tool called:
Updates: []
Deletions: []
Additions: [
  'User works in software development',
  'User has a dog named Max',
  'User enjoys hiking on weekends'
]
```

- [ ] Inspect the `data/memories.local.json` file after several exchanges

Verify that memories are being persisted correctly. Check that the memories reflect the information you shared.

- [ ] Test the update functionality by contradicting yourself

If you mentioned "I like coffee" earlier, later say "Actually, I prefer tea". The model should call the tool with an update operation.

- [ ] Verify memory persistence across sessions

Close and reopen the chat. Start a new conversation and mention something related to previous memories. The model should reference the remembered information in its responses.
