## Steps To Complete

### Understanding Reranking

- [ ] Understand that reranking improves search results by filtering out irrelevant chunks
  - Reranking takes a larger set of search results (e.g., 30 chunks)
  - An LLM evaluates which ones are truly relevant to the user's query
  - Only the most relevant chunks are returned to the user

- [ ] Review how the search algorithm currently works in `api/search.ts`
  - BM25 provides keyword-based matching scores
  - Embeddings provide semantic similarity scores
  - Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) combines both scores into a single ranking

### Implementing Reranking

- [ ] Locate the TODO comment in `api/search.ts` where reranking should be implemented

```ts
// TODO: Call generateObject to generate an array of IDs
// of the most relevant chunks, based on the user's search query.
// You should tell the LLM to return only the IDs, not the full chunks.
// You should also tell the LLM to be selective and only include chunks
// that are genuinely helpful for answering the question.
// If a chunk is only tangentially related or not relevant,
// exclude its ID.
const rerankedResults = TODO;
```

- [ ] Create a Zod schema that expects an array of numbers (chunk IDs)

```ts
const schema = z.object({
  resultIds: z
    .array(z.number())
    .describe('Array of IDs for the most relevant chunks'),
});
```

- [ ] Call `generateObject` with the appropriate parameters
  - Use `google('gemini-2.5-flash-lite')` as the model
  - Set a `system` prompt explaining the reranker's role and instructing it to be selective
  - Pass the `schema` you created
  - In the `prompt`, include the `searchQuery` and formatted `chunksWithId`

```ts
const rerankedResults = await generateObject({
  model: google('gemini-2.5-flash-lite'),
  system: `You are a search result reranker...`,
  schema,
  prompt: `Search query: ...\n\nAvailable chunks: ...`,
});
```

- [ ] Access the reranker's results using `rerankedResults.object.resultIds`

```ts
const approvedChunkIds: number[] =
  rerankedResults.object.resultIds;
```

### Testing The Implementation

- [ ] Run the application using `pnpm run dev`

- [ ] Run a test search query like "How did TypeScript start?"
  - Check that chunks appear with different rerank statuses:
    - "Approved" - chunks selected by the reranker (green)
    - "Rejected" - chunks not selected (red)
    - "Not Passed" - chunks not sent to reranker (gray)

- [ ] Experiment with different rerank counts using the UI input
  - Try values like 10, 20, 30, 50
  - Observe how approved chunks appear at the top of results

- [ ] Try different search queries to verify the reranker filters appropriately
