# Introduction to the Discord

I wanted to give you a brief introduction to the Discord and where you can ask questions. This is the [Matt AI Heroes Discord](https://aihero.dev/discord) and we have a few general purpose text channels.

## General Channels

The main channels available include:

- `#general` for all sorts of general chatter
- `#evalite` channel for talking about Evalite
- `#ai-hero` for general AI Hero stuff
- `#showcase`
- `#random`

However, the stuff that's most important for you is the **Cohort 002 channels**.

## Cohort 002 Channels

Here we have several dedicated channels:

| Channel                       | Purpose                                           |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `#cohort-002-general`         | General chatter (mostly cat photos at this point) |
| `#cohort-002-random`          | Where cat photos probably should go               |
| `#cohort-002-content-updates` | Real-time course improvements and updates         |
| `#cohort-002-questions`       | Where to ask for help                             |

## How to Ask Questions

The most important channel is going to be `#cohort-002-questions`. This is where you can press "new post" and add a title, for instance, "I'm stuck."

Then add an example message, something like "hello, please help." However, I strongly recommend that you be a bit more descriptive than this.

When posting a question, make sure to:

- Link to the exercise that you're on
- Be really specific so that people can dive in and help you
- Include code samples if you have them

You can use markdown formatting to share code. For example:

```ts
const foo = whatever;
```

When you post this, only people inside Cohort 002 can come and help.

## The Hero Role

Finally, people who are particularly helpful or particularly awesome get blessed with the hero role. If you see any red faces up there, treat them with particular respect and deference. If you're nice and helpful, then you may be given a hero role yourself!

Other than that, enjoy the Discord, and I'll see you in there!
