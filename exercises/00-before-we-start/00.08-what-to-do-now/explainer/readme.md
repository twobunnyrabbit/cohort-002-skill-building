Now that you're excited about the cohort and have completed all your prep work, what should you do next?

The first thing I recommend is checking out the [AI SDK v5 Crash Course](https://www.aihero.dev/workshops/ai-sdk-v5-crash-course), which you already have if you've purchased this course. The AI SDK v5 Crash Course is a prerequisite for this course—you need to have completed it to understand some of the material we're going to cover.

## What to Prioritize in the Crash Course

If you don't feel you have time to go through the entire course, definitely focus on these sections:

- **The basics** – essential foundational knowledge
- **Agent material** – covers key concepts you'll use throughout
- **Persistence** – critical for understanding data management
- **Evals** – especially important for Day Three

Understanding agents and workflows is really important for custom data parts, which is Day Five. The advanced patterns section will help you out too.

## Move Through It Quickly

It's possible to blast through the crash course pretty quickly if you're focused. You'll get the most out of it by moving steadily through the material.

Of course, if you've already taken it, feel free to go through it again to refresh your memory.

## What's Next

That's the last thing I have to say in this intro section. With that, all that's left is to wait for the cohort to begin.

I'll see you in the office hours, I'll see you in Discord, and I'll see you with my face teaching you things, of course. Happy waiting, and I will see you in the next one!
