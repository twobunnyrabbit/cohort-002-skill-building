## Quick Start

Clone the skill building repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ai-hero-dev/cohort-002-skill-building.git
```

Clone the project repository:

## Two Types of Activities

In this cohort, we're going to be doing two types of activities: skill building or project work.

Each day starts with skill building, where we do some problem and solution exercises and some explainers to build the skills we need. Then in the project work section, we go and apply those skills.

This should give a really nice balance of working on the skills individually and then applying them in a creative way.

## Repository Structure

There are two different repos—each for skill building and for the project:

| Repository     | Purpose                        | URL                                                                                               |
| -------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Skill Building | Problem and solution exercises | [AI Hero Dev Cohort 002 Skill Building](git@github.com:ai-hero-dev/cohort-002-skill-building.git) |
| Project        | Creative application of skills | [AI Hero Dev Cohort 002 Project](git@github.com:ai-hero-dev/cohort-002-project.git)               |

## Getting Started

To begin, you'll need to:

1. Clone the [skill building repository](git@github.com:ai-hero-dev/cohort-002-skill-building.git) to your local setup
2. Clone the [project repository](git@github.com:ai-hero-dev/cohort-002-project.git) separately
3. Check the instructions in each repository if you need additional guidance

Once that's done, you're ready to move on to the next exercise.

Good luck and see you in the next one!
